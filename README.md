# Learning Haskell

I'm learning functional programming and have chosen Haskell as the language to implement challenges and practice.

I'm using ChatGPT to generate coding challenge prompts for the most part.
 
## Compile & Run

To compile and run the challenges, run `test.sh`

```sh
bash test.sh
```

## Order

Here's the order in which I attempted these challenges.

1. [Odd Numbers](./challenges/oddNumbers.hs)
1. [Palindromes](./challenges/palindromes.hs)
1. [Smallest Integer](./challenges/smallestInteger.hs)
1. [Nth Smallest Integer](./challenges/nthSmallestInteger.hs)
